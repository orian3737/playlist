                OAuth2.0 is an industry-standard protocol for authorization, providing a secure way for applications to request access to resources on behalf of the user without exposing user credentials.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-2">
                The process involves user authorization, authorization code grant, and access token exchange. This framework acts as an intermediary for secure API interactions, like those necessary for connecting with Spotify.
